When we're talking about camera/view space we're talking about all the vertex coordinates as seen from the camera's perspective as the origin of the scene: the view matrix transforms all the world coordinates into view coordinates that are relative to the camera's position and direction.
To define a camera we need its position in world space, the direction it's looking at, a vector pointing to the right and a vector pointing upwards from the camera. We are creating a coordinate system with 3 perpendicular unit axes with camera position as the origin (see image 1).

Camera Position: The camera position is a vector in world space that points to the camera's position. glm::vec3 cameraPos = glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 3.0f);  

Camera Direction: The direction the camera is pointing at. Substracting the camera position vector from the scene's origin vector thus results in the direction vector we want. For the view matrix's coordinate system we want its z-axis to be positive and because by convention the camera points towards the negative z-axis we want to negate the direction vector.f we switch the subtraction order around we now get a vector pointing towards the camera's positive z-axis:
glm::vec3 cameraTarget = glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
glm::vec3 cameraDirection = glm::normalize(cameraPos - cameraTarget);

Right Axis: The next vector that we need is a right vector that represents the positive x-axis of the camera space. To get the right vector we use a little trick by first specifying an up vector that points upwards (in world space). Then we do a cross product on the up vector and the direction vector from step 2. Since the result of a cross product is a vector perpendicular to both vectors, we will get a vector that points in the positive x-axis's direction (if we would switch the cross product order we'd get a vector that points in the negative x-axis):

Up Axis: Now that we have both the x-axis vector and the z-axis vector, retrieving the vector that points to the camera's positive y-axis is relatively easy: we take the cross product of the right and direction vector:
glm::vec3 cameraUp = glm::cross(cameraDirection, cameraRight);

Look At: if you define a coordinate space using 3 perpendicular (or non-linear) axes you can create a matrix with those 3 axes plus a translation vector and you can transform any vector to that coordinate space by multiplying it with this matrix. This is exactly what the LookAt matrix does and now that we have 3 perpendicular axes and a position vector to define the camera space we can create our own LookAt matrix: (see image2)
glm::mat4 view;
view = glm::lookAt(glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 3.0f),
           glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f),
           glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));
The glm::LookAt function requires a position, target and up vector respectively.
Camera rotation around the screen:
const float radius = 10.0f;
float camX = sin(glfwGetTime()) * radius;
float camZ = cos(glfwGetTime()) * radius;
glm::mat4 view;
view = glm::lookAt(glm::vec3(camX, 0.0, camZ), glm::vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), glm::vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0));

Walk Around: 
glm::vec3 cameraPos   = glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f,  3.0f);
glm::vec3 cameraFront = glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f);
glm::vec3 cameraUp    = glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f,  0.0f);
view = glm::lookAt(cameraPos, cameraPos + cameraFront, cameraUp);
First we set the camera position to the previously defined cameraPos. The direction is the current position + the direction vector we just defined. This ensures that however we move, the camera keeps looking at the target direction.
void processInput(GLFWwindow *window)
{
    ...
    const float cameraSpeed = 0.05f; // adjust accordingly
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_W) == GLFW_PRESS)
        cameraPos += cameraSpeed * cameraFront;
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_S) == GLFW_PRESS)
        cameraPos -= cameraSpeed * cameraFront;
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_A) == GLFW_PRESS)
        cameraPos -= glm::normalize(glm::cross(cameraFront, cameraUp)) * cameraSpeed;
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_D) == GLFW_PRESS)
        cameraPos += glm::normalize(glm::cross(cameraFront, cameraUp)) * cameraSpeed;
}
If we want to move forward or backwards we add or subtract the direction vector from the position vector scaled by some speed value. If we want to move sideways we do a cross product to create a right vector and we move along the right vector accordingly. This creates the familiar strafe effect when using the camera.

Movement speed: Graphics applications and games usually keep track of a deltatime variable that stores the time it took to render the last frame. We then multiply all velocities with this deltaTime value. The result is that when we have a large deltaTime in a frame, meaning that the last frame took longer than average, the velocity for that frame will also be a bit higher to balance it all out. When using this approach it does not matter if you have a very fast or slow pc, the velocity of the camera will be balanced out accordingly so each user will have the same experience.
float deltaTime = 0.0f;	// Time between current frame and last frame
float lastFrame = 0.0f; // Time of last frame
float currentFrame = glfwGetTime();
deltaTime = currentFrame - lastFrame;
lastFrame = currentFrame;
void processInput(GLFWwindow *window)
{
    float cameraSpeed = 2.5f * deltaTime;
    [...]
}
since we're using deltaTime the camera will now move at a constant speed of 2.5 units per second. Together with the previous section we should now have a much smoother and more consistent camera system for moving around the scene

Look around: To look around the scene we have to change the cameraFront vector based on the input of the mouse. However, changing the direction vector based on mouse rotations is a little complicated and requires some trigonometry. 

Euler Angles: Euler angles are 3 values that can represent any rotation in 3D. There are 3 angles: pitch, yaw, roll (image 3).
The pitch is the angle that depicts how much we're looking up or down as seen in the first image. The second image shows the yaw value which represents the magnitude we're looking to the left or to the right. The roll represents how much we roll as mostly used in space-flight cameras. Each of the Euler angles are represented by a single value and with the combination of all 3 of them we can calculate any rotation vector in 3D.
For our camera system we only care about the yaw and pitch values.  Given a pitch and a yaw value we can convert them into a 3D vector that represents a new direction vector.
Let's imagine a triangle, but now looking at it from a top perspective with the adjacent and opposite sides being parallel to the scene's x and z axis (as if looking down the y-axis). (image 4)
If we visualize the yaw angle to be the counter-clockwise angle starting from the x side we can see that the length of the x side relates to cos(yaw). And similarly how the length of the z side relates to sin(yaw).
If we take this knowledge and a given yaw value we can use it to create a camera direction vector:
glm::vec3 direction;
direction.x = cos(glm::radians(yaw)); // Note that we convert the angle to radians first
direction.z = sin(glm::radians(yaw));
This solves how we can get a 3D direction vector from a yaw value, but pitch needs to be included as well. Let's now look at the y axis side as if we're sitting on the xz plane (image 5):
Similarly, from this triangle we can see that the direction's y component equals sin(pitch) so let's fill that in:
direction.y = sin(glm::radians(pitch));
However, from the pitch triangle we can also see the xz sides are influenced by cos(pitch) so we need to make sure this is also part of the direction vector. With this included we get the final direction vector as translated from yaw and pitch Euler angles:
direction.x = cos(glm::radians(yaw)) * cos(glm::radians(pitch));
direction.y = sin(glm::radians(pitch));
direction.z = sin(glm::radians(yaw)) * cos(glm::radians(pitch));
We've set up the scene world so everything's positioned in the direction of the negative z-axis. However, if we look at the x and z yaw triangle we see that a Î¸ of 0 results in the camera's direction vector to point towards the positive x-axis. To make sure the camera points towards the negative z-axis by default we can give the yaw a default value of a 90 degree clockwise rotation. Positive degrees rotate counter-clockwise so we set the default yaw value to: yaw = -90.0f;

Mouse Input: The idea is to store the last frame's mouse positions and calculate in the current frame how much the mouse values changed. The higher the horizontal or vertical difference, the more we update the pitch or yaw value and thus the more the camera should move.
First we will tell GLFW that it should hide the cursor and capture it. Capturing a cursor means that, once the application has focus, the mouse cursor stays within the center of the window (unless the application loses focus or quits). We can do this with one simple configuration call: glfwSetInputMode(window, GLFW_CURSOR, GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED);  

To calculate the pitch and yaw values we need to tell GLFW to listen to mouse-movement events. We do this by creating a callback function with the following prototype: void mouse_callback(GLFWwindow* window, double xpos, double ypos);
Here xpos and ypos represent the current mouse positions. As soon as we register the callback function with GLFW each time the mouse moves, the mouse_callback function is called: glfwSetCursorPosCallback(window, mouse_callback);  
When handling mouse input for a fly style camera there are several steps we have to take before we're able to fully calculate the camera's direction vector:
The first step is to calculate the offset of the mouse since last frame. We first have to store the last mouse positions in the application, which we initialize to be in the center of the screen (screen size is 800 by 600) initially: float lastX = 400, lastY = 300;
Then in the mouse's callback function we calculate the offset movement between the last and current frame:
float xoffset = xpos - lastX;
float yoffset = lastY - ypos; // reversed since y-coordinates range from bottom to top
lastX = xpos;
lastY = ypos;
const float sensitivity = 0.1f;
xoffset *= sensitivity;
yoffset *= sensitivity;
Next we add the offset values to the globally declared pitch and yaw values: yaw   += xoffset;
          pitch += yoffset;  
In the third step we'd like to add some constraints to the camera so users won't be able to make weird camera movements (also causes a LookAt flip once direction vector is parallel to the world up direction). The pitch needs to be constrained in such a way that users won't be able to look higher than 89 degrees (at 90 degrees we get the LookAt flip) and also not below -89 degrees. This ensures the user will be able to look up to the sky or below to his feet but not further. The constraints work by replacing the Euler value with its constraint value whenever it breaches the constraint:
if(pitch > 89.0f)
  pitch =  89.0f;
if(pitch < -89.0f)
  pitch = -89.0f;
The fourth and last step is to calculate the actual direction vector using the formula from the previous section:
glm::vec3 direction;
direction.x = cos(glm::radians(yaw)) * cos(glm::radians(pitch));
direction.y = sin(glm::radians(pitch));
direction.z = sin(glm::radians(yaw)) * cos(glm::radians(pitch));
cameraFront = glm::normalize(direction);
This computed direction vector then contains all the rotations calculated from the mouse's movement. Since the cameraFront vector is already included in glm's lookAt function we're set to go.

Zoom: 
void scroll_callback(GLFWwindow* window, double xoffset, double yoffset)
{
    Zoom -= (float)yoffset;
    if (Zoom < 1.0f)
        Zoom = 1.0f;
    if (Zoom > 45.0f)
        Zoom = 45.0f; 
}
When scrolling, the yoffset value tells us the amount we scrolled vertically. When the scroll_callback function is called we change the content of the globally declared fov variable. Since 45.0 is the default fov value we want to constrain the zoom level between 1.0 and 45.0.
We now have to upload the perspective projection matrix to the GPU each frame, but this time with the fov variable as its field of view: projection = glm::perspective(glm::radians(fov), 800.0f / 600.0f, 0.1f, 100.0f);  
glfwSetScrollCallback(window, scroll_callback);
